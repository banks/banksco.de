title: Moving Data and Telling People About It
---
**I published an article for work on [our recent database migration](http://dt.deviantart.com/journal/Moving-6-Billion-Messages-Without-Being-Noticed-285571516) that I was involved with. **

It was an unorthodox approach which seemed to work well for this particular dataset and hardware/time constraints but certianly not perfect. Some interesting discussion followed.

I'm also secretly quite proud I got a mention on [highscalability.com's weekly roundup](http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/2/24/stuff-the-internet-says-on-scalability-for-february-24-2012.html). Thanks Todd!
