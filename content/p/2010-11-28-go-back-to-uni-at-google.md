**If you read this blog you'll be aware that I am a geek and love finding new resources to learn more about geeky things online for free. I've lately found two great resources which will keep me interested for a while.**

First is a set of lectures for an entire module on Analysis of Algorithms from MIT which is available from [Peteris Krumins' blog](http://www.catonmat.net/blog/mit-introduction-to-algorithms-part-one) (the videos were released under CC license). Fascinating and a great resource - made me realise how much I missed learning real subjects from real academics!

Second resource is probably more well-known but new to me. It's [Google's Code University](http://code.google.com/edu/) which seems to be a great resource listing many courses and materials on a wide range of computer science subjects.

It like christmas come early!
