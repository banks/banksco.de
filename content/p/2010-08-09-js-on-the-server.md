title: JS on the server?
---

Server-side javascript is something that I have been dimly aware of for a while now. At first, I thought it was yet another pointless attempt to use technology in ways it wasn't designed to be used, but recently it's been starting to make a little more sense to me.

I won't go into too much detail here because [ReadWriteWeb](http://www.readwriteweb.com) have [done it better](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/server-side_javascript_back_with_a_vengeance.php). Also of interest, Felix Geisend√∂rfer (a former CakePHP contributor) also [explains why he's more interested in Node.js now](http://debuggable.com/posts/understanding-node-js:4bd98440-45e4-4a9a-8ef7-0f7ecbdd56cb).

The most interesting point for me is this: JS is currently getting a lot of attention (read millions of dollars) from many of the biggest players in the industry: Google, Apple, Mozilla and Microsoft. That means it is being optimized and getting faster at a rate that other server side languages can only dream of.

I've heard (but not verified) that some bits of Node.js' C++ runtime have actually been re-written in JS because there was no performance difference!

Now I love JS as a language, it is getting seriously quick, and we are getting closer to having a stable and relatively mature stack to write applications with. It probably isn't going to power the next twitter but this is certainly worth looking into.
