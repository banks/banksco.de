**Just got pointed to [a very cool project](http://www.stanford.edu/~pgbovine/cde.html) at stanford to allow linux command executions to be trivially packaged up with all dependencies on one machine and executed on another with no install/dependency issues.**

Not tried it yet but it looks like a great and thoroughly useful little tool!
