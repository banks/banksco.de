**I've not posted for ages. So here is a summary of a bunch of stuff I've been looking at for fun.**

### Machine Learning

First up, after finishing the [MIT Introduction to Algorithms](http://blog.banksdesigns.co.uk/post/go-back-to-uni-at-google) lectures, I was excited to hear about [Stanford's free computer science courses](http://www.openculture.com/2008/09/free_stanford_computer_science_engineering_courses_now_online.html). They are full, taught and (machine) assessed university modules for free! I'm studying [Machine Learning](http://www.ml-class.org) and I am really impressed with the quality of the teaching. Thanks Stanford.

There is of course speculation that this is a trial for a new paid remote service. To be honest I feel the quality of the course I've done would be worth paying for if they could find a way to acredit something as a real qualification without proper human assessment.

### C++ Experiments

Following on from [my experiments with LevelDB](http://blog.banksdesigns.co.uk/post/leveldb-fun), I have played around with creating a C++ gossip implementation [based on Cassandra's](http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/ArchitectureGossip) using [ZeroMQ](http://www.zeromq.org/). I spent a lot of time getting a really basic grasp on the intricacies of threading vs event driven style + message passing etc. Ended up with multiple processes on same machine (different ports) gossiping and effectively sharing cluster state. Didn't get around to implementing the full [phi accrual failure detection](http://nosql.mypopescu.com/post/3479538825/distributed-systems-the-phi-accrual-failure-detector) for machine/up down inference and I'm sure the code would need to be torn apart and re-written for anythign resembling real use, but a good learning exercise.

I've now moved on to fiddling about with on-disk data structures. So far I'm mostly just learning. I've read through the specs for [SQLite's db file](http://www.sqlite.org/fileformat2.html) and some articles on [CouchDB's Copy-on-write B-tree](http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/btree.html) (not to mention LevelDB/Cassandra's [LSM trees](http://nosqlsummer.org/paper/lsm-tree)). I've also read [Acuna's paper on Stratified B-Trees](http://www.acunu.com/blogs/andy-twigg/stratified-btrees/) which is all really interesting stuff. Not quite sure what I want to implement now but I may start with trying to get a basic block and free-list allocator working. Just the experience of actually working with C++ and "real" algorithms is fascinating for me, a lowly PHP developer.

In summary then, I'm still doing loads of geeky computer stuff, just forgetting to write about any of it.
