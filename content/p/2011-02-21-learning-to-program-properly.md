title: Learning to program properly
---

**Being inspired by [MIT's introduction to algorithms](http://www.catonmat.net/series/mit-introduction-to-algorithms) I've decided to put some of my newly learnt stuff into practice. And there is not a lot of point in implementing this stuff a language like PHP or JS.**

So I'm re-learning C. I learnt some very basics as part of my degree and have worked with Objective-C a fair bit so it's not completely alien. It's taken me a lot longer than it was suggested it should, but I've finally got a working implementation of skip lists. 

Getting my head back around pointer arithmetic and memory management is a good exercise.

I feel like despite all the cool new languages around, most real infrastructure and interesting technology is still written in real languages like C.
