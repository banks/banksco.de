title: PHP Arrays (Again)
---

**I have mentioned PHP array inefficiency a [few](http://blog.banksdesigns.co.uk/post/when-not-to-use-arrays-in-php) [times](http://blog.banksdesigns.co.uk/post/more-efficient-php-arrays) on this blog.**

Discussing it at work today someone linked me to [a much more thorough review of the topic](http://nikic.github.com/2011/12/12/How-big-are-PHP-arrays-really-Hint-BIG.html) that is interesting and readable.

I'm finding myself so much more interested in this level of stuff than the typical PHP programmer which I guess is why I spend my free time playing with other, generally statically typed, languages...
