title: +1 to Textmate
---
**I posted [a little while back](http://blog.banksdesigns.co.uk/post/the-era-of-komodo-edit) about my trialling of Komodo edit as an IDE. It's good, but just a couple of things bugged me enough that I thought I'd see if I could live with the major change that is switching to [TextMate](http://macromates.com/).**

Now to be completely fair, most of my gripes with Komodo edit were minor and were more to do with what I'm used to than it being a bad product. Since starting a new job (more to come soon) I discovered a few really useful tools had been written for our codebase for the latest beta of Komodo Edit (v6) so I switched to that.

The thing which made me try TextMate instead was actually that Komodo Edit 6 kept eating my CPU time for no real reason. After using it for a bit, even when I was doing nothing and there was no indication of background activity, it's CPU usage would sit at around 30% which over a while slowed my Mac right down and got it really hot (and loud). If I quit and restarted it would be fine again for a while but eventually would come back up.

This isn't all that surprising especially considering it is a beta version but it was annoying enough to make me consider alternatives again. Especially since TextMate is also favoured by other devs at my new place of work.

Actually I like it. It is less limited than I first thought and writing bundles is powerful and could allow me to reproduce many of the simpler features I miss from other editors. Full code completion isn't there but actually it does do basic PHP and same-file completion which covers a relatively large part of my needs. And I really love the speed and OSXiness.

So the Jury's still out. I'll see how I get on.
