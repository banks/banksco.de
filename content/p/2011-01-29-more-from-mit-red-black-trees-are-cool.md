title: "More from MIT: Red-Black Trees are Cool"
---
**I mentioned [a while back](http://blog.banksdesigns.co.uk/post/go-back-to-uni-at-google) that I had found the lecture videos and notes for MIT's Introduction to algorithms course on [Peter Krumins' blog](http://www.catonmat.net/series/mit-introduction-to-algorithms). I'm still watching them, and they keep getting better.**

I don't have anything particularly sophisticated to say about them other than being really impressed by  [Red-Black trees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-black_trees).

I've found the lectures have not only taught me a lot of things my formal education has lacked regarding algorithms, but it has helped change the way I view problems and enhanced my analytical skills, even without the problem sets, recitation, and "quizzes". You can probably see that by my [over-analysis of a simple JS algorithm](http://blog.banksdesigns.co.uk/post/quick-benchmarks-with-jsfiddle) in my last post.

If you are interested in programming and you didn't learn this stuff at Uni, (or even if you did) I'd highly recommend the lectures once again
