title: Living it LArge
---

**I've just got back (well technically not back yet) from my first trip to LA to meet my co-workers in person!**

I really enjoyed it. The hospitality, food and party was great but actually I also really valued being able to talk work face-to-face with my colleagues for the first time. Such subtleties such as facial expression and body language have given me a much clearer idea of what people are like and how they are likely to respond. I'm sure it will make future online discussion significantly easier.

So there isn't much to say here other than I had a great time.
