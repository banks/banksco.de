title: LevelDB Fun

**Google recenetly open-sourced [LevelDB](http://code.google.com/p/leveldb/) which is "a fast key-value storage library". I've used it as an excuse to play about in C++.**

There is nothing new or exciting to report to the tech world here - just that I've enjoyed playing about in a language I've not worked much with in the past. 

So far I have hooked up [libevent](http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/) to LevelDB and made my own little Key-Value database server that can accept multiple clients.

I've also written a C++ client library to talk to it and made up my own Ascii-based data transfer format.

None of this is useful to anyone other than me - it's great to actually play around with a language like this and to get a feel for it. Much more productive that code tutorials or algorithm exercises.
