title: Getting Social

I've enabled comments on the blog using [DISQUS](http://disqus.com). Sure I could have written my own into my lovely little rails app but that would be a lot of effort once moderation, spam control, user signup, OpenID integration etc. are included.

DISQUS actually seems to be quite a neat solution for now and will hopefully make this content slightly more interesting once I start getting a bit of traffic through.

I still have a couple of things to add to the blog (including more content) before I make more of an effort to get spidered and promoted at large on the web.
