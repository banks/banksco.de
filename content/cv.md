## Curriculum Vitae

I am a professional Software Engineer.
I live in Devon, UK, working remotely for [DeviantArt](http://www.deviantart.com).
I started my career as a full-stack web developer and have experience with native mobile development but I'm increasingly drawn to distributed systems problems and scalable architecture design.
If you know of opportunities to work in that space, especially any supporting remote work, I'd love to hear from you.
